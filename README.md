###### Branching Strategy
    I chose to use the github flow because it is easier for me to understand, it is easier to manage since i will be working to on my own in this projects and not in a team. Also because each feature will have its own branch thus reducing the chances of my whole system breaking

## Purpose of .gitignore
    The .gitignore file commands instruct git which files to ignore. It is used to prevent committing temporary files from your working directory

# Storage of credentials and sensitive information
    The use of authorisation authentication to access the database will be used and sesitive will be encrypted to prevent the information being seen by the wrong people
